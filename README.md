Program made in Java using JavaFX and MySQL during my second year of High School at FMM (Fundação Matias Machline)

Softmed program was developed in order to make consultations and medical follow-up easier.

To run the app:

1. Install MySQL Workbench

2. Set up the user root with the password: 1234

3. Run the sql commands contained in the "Banco - Softmed.sql" file

4.Run the program

After running the sql commands, 2 users can be used:

medic --> login: alberto12 // password: 1234

patient --> login: ronaldo7 // password: 1234

Also is possible to register others users and use the program normally.

The medic can provide the appointment days and the patient can make an appointment to see the doctor on available days.
